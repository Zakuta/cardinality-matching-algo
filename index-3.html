<p>This is an implementation of Maximum Cardinality Matching Algorithm for finding matching with maximum cardinality given an undirected graph in rutime O( n m logn). It was written for an exercise assignment of the <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/lectures/ws16/cows16.html">Combinatorial Optimization lecture (WS 2016/17)</a> held by Prof. Stefan Hougardy at Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics, University of Bonn.</p>
<p>The algorithm is in tandem with the implementation outlined in Combinatorial Optimization book (Fifth Edition) by Prof. Korte and Prof. Vygen and further uses some of the suggested optimizations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Union-Find datastructure for odd-cycle mapping. The implmentation uses path compression to achieve nearly constant amortized costs for FIND operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resetting the only affected part of the tree structure in each augment operation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Auxiliary heuristics applied that is not explicitly mentioned in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an extra speed-up, starting with a greedy matching until it is maximal (can be found in linear time).</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be a fun exercise to find other heuristics and optimizations that are suited for our use case.</p>
